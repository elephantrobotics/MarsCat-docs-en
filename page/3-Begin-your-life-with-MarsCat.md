## 3.3 Getting the living environment ready
After the cat bowl and charging pile are assembled, the living environment of MarsCat can be arranged. In order to ensure that MarsCat can leave the charging pile after eating and charging, do not place any objects around the cat bowl and charging pile that may interfere with the activities of MarsCat's Martian bionic cat

When MarsCat enters foraging mode, it will walk to the cat bowl and eat when it recognizes the QR code of the cat bowl

The charging pile is used to charge the MarsCat. For details, see [** How to Charge **](./4-Raising-MarsCat.md).

In the QR code you received, there is also a QR code belonging to the cat's nest. You can post this QR code at any position (within the height of camera recognized by MarsCat). After MarsCat successfully identifies the QR code, it will autonomously navigate to the cat's nest
