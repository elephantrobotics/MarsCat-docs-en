Step3: MarsCat will go to the charging station to charge itself **when its battery is lower than 15%(its eyes will show a low battery sign)**; **the charging station is within the range of its vision(3\*3m)**

MarsCat will not charge itself only if both the above two conditions are met.

Unplug the charger immediately after full charge to avoid damage to the charger or MarsCat due to prolonged charging heat.

**4.2.2 Manual charging**

When MarsCat fails to find its charging station, you need to charge it manually.
Lay down MarsCat on the charging station so that the charging pins on the belly are engaged with the charge connector on the charging station.

Or you can use the charger to charge MarsCat directly, other steps are the same as step4-5 in automatic charging.
