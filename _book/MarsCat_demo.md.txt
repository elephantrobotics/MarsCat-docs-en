5. Character Development
========================

5.1 Learn about your MarsCat
----------------------------

MarsCat is the world's first bionic pet cat developed by Elephant
Robotics, aiming to be a home robot, a robotic pet to comfort you and
surprise you.

MarsCat can walk, run, sleep, sit, stretch, bites nail, knead and even
bury litter although she won't produce any waste. It may express
different emotions by different meows or gestures. It can feel your
touch, hear your voice, see your face and play with toys.

Every MarsCat is unique from its eye to body. It also has different
characters and personalities. Some cats are vivacious, while some are
lazy. Some cats are aloof while some are more close to human. Also, some
cats are super curious and they meow frequently.

MarsCat is built to allow you to shape its personalities according to
the way you pet it. More interactions with MarsCat will impel it to be
more close to you. More conversations with MarsCat will impel it to meow
to you often. Every time you touch it, talk to it or even let it see
you, will change its personality.

![性格](image\MarsCat_demo\1619491502181.png)

5.2 Daily life of MarsCat
-------------------------

With bionic designed and high-tech, MarsCat have independent and
autonomous living systems. Different types of sensors including image,
voice and touch are integrated to carry out feature extraction, pattern
recognition and action planning to build intelligent brain for MarsCat.

Just like a real cat, MarsCat has capabilities to understand where it is
or whom it is with, and acts based on its feelings and instincts. You
will never know what MarsCat will do next. Free to walk, play with toys
or sleep in a daze? MarsCat have more freedom to do what she wants to
do.

Rather than a toy, MarsCat is more like a friend or a family that
accompanies you to grow up together.

7.Notes on use
==============

7.1 Precautions for MarsCat
---------------------------

Follow Usage Instruction in strict(Usage Instruction sent with MarsCat)
to operate correctly. Customer should take risks of damage caused by
irregular operations.

7.1.1On handling MarsCat

-   Do not use MarsCat on an unstable place or a place from which
    MarsCat may fall off to avoid a physical injury or a malfunction of
    MarsCat.
-   Do not place fragile or dangerous objects around MarsCat to avoid
    property damage or a freak accident.
-   Do not use MarsCat on a table or in other situations where a fall
    may occur. MarsCat can only be used on flat
-   ground. Note that Elephant Robotics will not be responsible for any
    damage or loss caused by such fall or collision.

7.1.2To avoid injury

-   Do not put your hands or fifingers in gaps around MarsCat's movable
    parts.
-   Do not lift, swing or twist around MarsCat by only grasping its
    head, tail or any movable parts.
-   Do not pull MarsCat's tail hard. Noted that it's designed for safety
    that MarsCat's tail come off from the body when it's forcefully
    pulled.
-   If MarsCat's tail comes off from the body, please put the detached
    tail to the protruded base component, and then push the tail toward
    MarsCat's body to let the component go into the receptacle hole of
    the tail.
-   Do not use MarsCat on a hard or slippery floor, MarsCat may fail to
    sit up or move forward. It is recommended that you use MarsCat on a
    wooden flfloor or a carpet with short threads.
-   Keep MarsCat's movable parts free of anything that can restrict
    their movements, such as a sticker or a ribbon.
-   Do not lubricate MarsCat's movable parts.
-   Do not allow a strong physical impact (e.g. dropping MarsCat) or
    exert excessive force (e.g. putting a heavy object on MarsCat) on
    MarsCat to avoid the risk of malfunction.
-   Do not leave MarsCat in a place subject to extremely high/low
    temperatures or high humidity. MarsCat's operating temperature range
    is from 5 °C to 35 °C (41 °F to 95 °F). Use of MarsCat in an
    extremely cold or hot place where the temperature falls below or
    exceeds the range may cause a malfunction of MarsCat.

7.1.3On cleaning

-   When MarsCat or the charging station is soiled with small particles
    and dust, gently wipe them off with a dry, soft cloth.
-   Do not use any volatile agent, such as alcohol or paint thinner, to
    avoid damaging the surface.
-   If residues of dust or fifingerprints are found on MarsCat's camera
    or sensor covers, do not touch them with bare hands. Instead, blow
    them off with a commercially available blower or wipe them off with
    a soft cloth.

7.1.4Moisture condensation

-   If MarsCat is brought directly from a cold place to a warm place,
    moisture may condense inside or on the surface of it and cause a
    malfunction of MarsCat.

    on the power. Turn on the power until moisture condensation leave or
    you can wipe MarsCat with a dry cloth.

7.1.5Heat generation

-   MarsCat and the supplied power adapter may generate heat while they
    are in use. Heat generation is caused by the operation of internal
    electric circuits or the electric current that flflows during
    battery charge and does not indicate a malfunction
-   The amount of heat generated by MarsCat depends on its activity.
-   When MarsCat or the supplied power adapter is extremely hot to the
    touch when compared to its usual state, unplug the charger and stop
    charging.
